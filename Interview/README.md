# Interview Assignment
This folder contain some interview assigment, code might not be optimal and polish due to time constraint.

### ScanSdStorage
goal of project is to scan external storage and output 10 biggest files, average file size and 5 most frequent file ectensions 
Some improvement to the app with more time would be to fully use Dagger2 to implement DI as well as optimize some thread handling
as well as better handling of activity states.
